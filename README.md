# Netflix Clone

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Netflix UI Clone** built using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool.  
The main goal of this project is to understand modern React development, component-based architecture, and fast bundling using Vite.

The application focuses on replicating the **frontend user interface** of Netflix, not backend services like authentication or payments.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **React.js** – Component-based UI development  
- **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Application logic  
- **CSS / Tailwind CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **TMDB API** (optional) – For fetching movie data  

## ✨ Features
- Netflix-style homepage UI  
- Reusable React components  
- Dynamic movie sections (Trending, Originals, etc.)  
- Responsive design for different screen sizes  
- Fast loading and hot module replacement using Vite
